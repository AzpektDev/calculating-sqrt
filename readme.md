# Square Root Calculator

This Python script calculates the square root of a given number with a specified precision. It utilizes an iterative method to approximate the square root based on the provided number and precision.

## How it Works

The program follows these steps to calculate the square root:

1. Take the input number and precision from the user.
2. Initialize an approximation of the square root and iterate to refine the approximation.
3. Update the approximation using the average of the current approximation and the input number divided by the current approximation.
4. Repeat this process until the difference between the current approximation squared and the input number is within the specified precision.
